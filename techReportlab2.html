1. WHat is your element CSS class?
My element CSS class is the table.border class that affects the border of the table. 

2. What is your global CSS class?
My global CSS class is the .color class for the background color of the website. 

3. What are your HTML5-only tags?
The two HTML5-only tags that I used were 'mark' and 'wbr'. The 'mark' tag highlighted the "shapes, size, and colour" in a sentence on the webpage. The 'wbr' tag is a work break opportunity tag which specifies where it is okay to insert a line break. In my case I put it after the word 'different' in the same sentence.  

4. What are you CSS3--only tags?
The two CSS3-only tags that I used were 'border' with 'border-radius' and 'box-shadow'. I put a black rounded border around my table and a shadow border around my banner image. 

5. Did you use the same protection method?
I used the same method.

6. How long did you spend on this lab?
Approximately 2.5 hours.
