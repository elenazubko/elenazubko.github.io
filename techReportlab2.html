3. What are your HTML5-only tags?
The two HTML5-only tags that I used were 'mark' and 'wbr'. The 'mark' tag highlighted the "shapes, size, and colour" in a sentence on the webpage. The 'wbr' tag is a work break opportunity tag which specifies where it is okay to insert a line break. In my case I put it after the word 'different' in the same sentence.
