2. How did you password protect your page?   
I password protected it through a function I found online. It asks you for a prompt, and then checks what the user inputs by using an 'if' statement. If the password is correct,it will let the user into the website, but if it is incorrect it will send the user to the previous page.

3. What new tag did you try? What were the effects? The tag that I tried was the image tag. It added a png. image to my website that was used as a banner and title.

4. Does your page look different in different browsers? My page does not look different in different browsers. I tested this on Google Chrome, Safari, and Firefox.

5. How long did you spend on this lab? I spent approximately 4 hours on this lab because I have a Macbook and it was difficult to figure out how to host the website.
